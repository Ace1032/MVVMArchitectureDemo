# Project Name: MVVMdemo

Description:
MVVMdemo is an Android app showcasing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. The MainActivity serves as the View, observing changes in data from the ViewModel. The ViewModel, represented by CityViewModel, retrieves city data from CityDataProvider in the Model layer. Using LiveData, ViewModel streams data to MainActivity without MainActivity having direct reference to ViewModel. This separation enhances code organization and maintainability.

## Key Features:

Demonstrates MVVM architecture pattern in Android.
Separates concerns between View, ViewModel, and Model layers.
Uses LiveData for reactive data updates.
Promotes loose coupling and scalability.
Usage:

## Clone the repository.
Open project in Android Studio.
Build and run on emulator or device.
Explore codebase for MVVM implementation in Android.

## Note:
MVVMdemo is an educational project for understanding MVVM architecture in Android. Use it as a reference or starting point for your projects. Contributions are welcome!
